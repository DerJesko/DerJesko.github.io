            <h2>Transpanent-Setup Hidden-Order Group from Factoring</h2>
            <p>
                There are some applications like vector commitments, like vector commitments, verifiable delay
                functions,
                or time-lock puzzles, where you need a hidden-order group. As far as I know there are essentially two
                candidates: the RSA group or a class group. If you want a transparent setup for the group it seems you
                can only use class groups. Here, I will explain how you can still use something similar to the RSA
                group. This comes at the cost of a multiplicative overhead roughly linear in the security parameter λ.
                So,
                it seems like a strictly theoretical contribution.

                The basic idea is to sample λ many big numbers N<sub>1</sub>,...,N<sub>λ</sub> uniformly at random. Each
                of them has a constant probability of being hard to factor. As long as N<sub>i</sub> is hard to factor
                the multiplicative group over N<sub>i</sub> has a hidden order. Therefore, the multiplicative group over
                N<sub>1</sub>·...·N<sub>λ</sub> has a hidden order with all but negligible probability.
