                There are some applications like <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/495.pdf">vector commitments</a>,

                    href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1272.pdf">TCML</a>] where you need a
                hidden-order group. As far as I know
                there are essentially two candidates: the RSA group or a class group. If you want a transparent setup
                for the group it seems you can only use class groups. Here, I will explain how you can still use
                something similar to the RSA group. This comes at the cost of a multiplicative overhead roughly linear
                in the security parameter λ. So, it seems like a strictly theoretical contribution.

            <p>
                The basic idea is to sample λ many big numbers N<sub>1</sub>,...,N<sub>λ</sub> uniformly at random. Each
                of them has a constant probability of being hard to factor. As long as N<sub>i</sub> is hard to factor
                the multiplicative group over N<sub>i</sub> has a hidden order. Therefore, the multiplicative group over
                N<sub>1</sub>·...·N<sub>λ</sub> has a hidden order with all but negligible probability.

            <h3>Random Number Hard to Factor?</h3>
            <p>
                As far as I can tell, a number is hard to factor if its second biggest prime factor is big. So, if I
                sample a random 3072-bit number and it happens to have two ≥1024-bit prime factors then it seems to be
                as hard to factor as a 2048-bit RSA modulus. As one can see in this <a
                    href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/375503">math stackexchange post</a>, the probability that the
                second largest prime factor of a random 3072-bit number is &gt;1024-bit is around 15%. Therefore, to
                have a 2<sup>-60</sup> probability that one of the N<sub>i</sub> is hard to factor, we need to sample
                ~256 numbers.
