            <h2>Certified RSA Permutations</h2>
            <p>
                The amazing work of [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/89549">FLS</a>] showed how to build
                non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments for all of NP from trapdoor permutations. Later, it was noticed
                [<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~Mihir/papers/cct.pdf">BY</a>,<a
                    href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/COL/nizk-tdp.pdf">G11</a>,<a
                    href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/VO/tdp.pdf">GR</a>,<a
                    href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/631.pdf">CL</a>] that FLS implicitly assumed a few properties
                about trapdoor permutations that the canidates for trapdoor permutations did not have. These problems
                have been rectified in the papers that notice these issues.

                For anyone reading this: In the middle of writing this article I discovered that my observation that
                RSA with an encryption exponent e that is prime and bigger than N is a certified trapdoor permutation is
                already in a footnote of [<a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/VO/tdp.pdf">GR</a>], which is
                I never finished this article.
